## Challenge 1:

The company wants to create a platform where users could stake their tokens. This will allow users
to participate in (vote) different Surveys. When a user stakes some amount of a particular token (ex: BAR) it
gives them the possibility to vote on any survey linked to that token (ie: BAR).

Design an upgradeable smart contracts architecture to tackle this challenge. Consider security risks and
maintainability.

Describe possible improvements. Eventually provide a diagram.
